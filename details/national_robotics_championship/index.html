You add some sensing and some motors around it. You then go through a process of mathematical modeling and algorithm design that is usually highly abstracted and can be very detached from reality. But then, and here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting, you apply those algorithms to the hardware, and voila! Now you have a living, breathing machine with character and embedded smarts, and it&rsquo;s thrilling!</p>

						<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>About:</strong></span></p>

<p>This year NRC comes back again with an exciting event to present your skills in the field of robotics in the form of LINE FOLLOWER. All you need is to gather your gadgets and come up with marvellous bots to compete against the best rivals. It&rsquo;s time to showcase your passion towards robotics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Problem statement:</strong></span></p>

<p>Line follower is an autonomous robot which follows black line in white background. The objective of this contest is to complete the course in the shortest period of time with less number of deviations from the path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Robot Specifications:</strong></span></p>

<p>The robot must fit on an A4 piece of paper.</p>

<p>There is no weight limitation. Robots must have passed inspection prior to competing.</p>

<p>Robots have to have an easily reachable emergency stop button which interrupts the power supply of the actuators.</p>

<p>On demand of the jury or in imminent danger, a team member has to stop the robot immediately.</p>

<p>Robots have to operate autonomously and should not be remote-controlled.</p>

<p>All systems (like sensors, power supply, data-processing and control-systems) have to completely reside on the robot.</p>

<p>No limitation as such in the motors.</p>

<p>The wheels used must be non-destructive to the surface.</p>

<p>Energy sources like springs, compressed-air, batteries, etc. are permitted.</p>

<p>Combustion engines are not allowed because of noise and exhaust gas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Course Specifications:</strong></span></p>

<p>The line following course shall traverse a white paper rectangle (approx. 3mx1m). The line shall be a black printed one while the base is white traversing the arena from end to end.</p>

<p>The width of the black line is 3cm</p>

<p>There shall be a starting area at the beginning of the course and an exit area at the end. The line course starts inside the starting area and ends inside the exit area.</p>

<p>There shall be crossovers (e.g. places where the line crosses itself)</p>

<p>Switchbacks and hairpins are possible, but the adjacent sections of the line shall be no closer together than 15cm when measured from the center of each line.</p>

<p>The line course may have one or more sharp right-angle and some acute and obtuse angles.</p>

<p>The closest approach of the line course to the edges of the arena shall be no less than 15cm, measured from the center of the line.</p>

<p>The decisions of all officials regarding these rules and the conduct of the event shall be final.</p>

<p>There will be a total of three rounds and we will be following a knockout system for each round</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Rules and regulations:</strong></span></p>

<p>Team may have a maximum of 5 members.</p>

<p>The robot has to be developed and designed by the team itself. The usage of commercially complete robotic-systems which are sold ready for the purpose of the competition is not allowed. At least the software-development should show significant personal effort.</p>

<p>The time of any run is measured from the time the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when the forward most wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line.</p>

<p>Time measurement: Time shall be measured by an electronic gate system or by a judge with a stopwatch, based on the availability of equipment. In either case the recorded time shall be final.</p>

<p>A robot that wanders off of the arena surface will be disqualified.</p>

<p>A robot shall be deemed to have left the arena when any wheel, leg, or track has moved completely off the arena surface.</p>

<p>Losing the Line: any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point.</p>

<p>Robots have to stay on the ground. Thus they may not fly or jump. All kinds of weapons (saws, lasers, electroshocks, hammer) are strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>Claims because of changing lighting conditions in the room or flash lights of photographers won&#39;t be accepted. Participants have to face these &quot;disturbances&quot;.</p>

<p>Equipment which harms or disturbs another robot (e.g. jammer, light flash, interfering ultrasonic or infrared transmitter) are forbidden. Disturbances or assistance caused by intervention of humans during a competition are forbidden as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong></span></p>

<p>A maximum time of 5 minutes is allowed for a robot to complete the course. A robot that cannot complete the course in the allotted time shall be disqualified.</p>

<p>The track is divided into checkpoints at various locations.</p>

<p>On completion of the whole track in given time, the team is given 40 points.</p>

<p>For teams which complete within 5 minutes extra points will be given</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round-1:</strong></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">A team will be awarded 20 points upon crossing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">In this round a maximum of 3 corrections are allowed. For every next correction the team will be&nbsp;deducted with 3 points.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 2:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teams which clear round 1 will participate in this round</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">A team will be awarded 30 points on crossing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">In this round no corrections are allowed. For any correction the team will be deducted with 5 points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 3:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teams which clear the previous rounds will participate in this&nbsp;round</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp; A team will be awarded 50 points on crossing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp;In this round no corrections are allowed. For any correction the team will be deducted with 8 points.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The organizers reserve the right to change any or all of the rules as they deem fit.</p>

<p>Violation of any of the rules will lead to disqualification. Event Managers decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.</p>

<p>The teams may be asked questions on the design of the circuit and other details on the implementation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you ever wondered, what will happen when the formidable robots will clash? It will be a battle every human aspires to watch. An event that you cannot miss and a memory which you cannot erase. It&rsquo;s not often when you watch machines destroying each other for entertainment. Gears will grind and sparks will fly, much more is at stake as the robots battle it out in a bid to be the best. These messengers of destruction will duel for honour and denomination with pneumatic pincers, weedy axes, chain saw tails, hurling maces, flamethrowers and loads more. A War that will bring your hearts in your mouth.</p>

<p>Be there to witness the impossible</p>

<p>Be there to get goose bumped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The objective is to make a manually controlled bot capable of immobilizing ,fighting aggressively with control and ultimately knocking out of other bot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>TEAM DETAILS:</strong></span></p>

<p>Each team must consist a maximum of 5 members .2 members of&nbsp; the team are allowed to handle the bot during the match.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>BOT SPECIFICATIONS:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;The machine should fit in a box of dimension 60cm x 60cm x 60cm (l x b x h) during the starting of the match. The external device (remote) used to control the machine is not included in the size constraint. (However there is no limitation on dimension once the match starts). The ground clearance of the bot must be 3mm for bot&#39;s convienience. 10% allowance in dimensions shall be given to the bots with on board power supply</p>

<p>The machine should not exceed 60&nbsp;kg of weight including power supply. Here the power supply refers to the wires in externally powered bot and battery for a wireless bot. 10% allowance in weight shall be given to the bots with off board power supply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;MOBILITY:</strong></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; The bots should use only wheels for moving.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Jumping, Flying, Hopping of bots is not allowed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;ROBOT CONTROL:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; The machine can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. Off board power supplies are allowed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the machine is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the machine should be stacked as a single unit. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires. Loose connections may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.</li>
	<li>If the machine is controlled wirelessly, the machine must at least have a four frequency control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.</li>
	<li>The robots are not allowed to cut the opponents control wire.</li>
	<li>Violation of this rule will lead to disqualification</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;POWER SYSTEM:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>The bot must be powered by electrical means only. Other means of powering the system like use of IC engines, Pneumatics in any form is not allowed.</p>

<p>The electric voltage between any two points in a machine should not exceed 36v DC at any point of time. The same is the case with AC as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;BATTERY:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;On board Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).</p>

<p>&nbsp;All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct&nbsp; &nbsp;disqualification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;USAGE OF WEAPONS:</strong></span></p>

<p>Robots can have any kind of magnetic weapons, cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. as weapons with following exceptions and limitations:</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">Problem Statement:</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Mobile Controlled Robot is a mobile device, which provides wide-range of wireless control ability to your robot unless your cell phone gets out of signal. The objective is to build a bot which can navigate using your instructions through DTMF controlled by your mobile phone and maneuver the bot through the arena.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>TEAMDETAILS:</strong></p>

<p>Each team consists a maximum of 5 members. Only one member of the team is allowed to handle the bot during a match.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">SPECIFICATIONS:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Base of the machine must not be greater than 0.30 m * 0.25 m (Length * Breadth). No limit on weight of the bot&nbsp;control of the bot can be done through any switches in the mobile which the participants are using communication between the rover and the participant will be through DTMF. It cannot be IR beams, GSM, Bluetooth and radio services. Onboard power supply should not exceed 12V DC between any two points in the machine. A robot&rsquo;s program is the responsibility of the team. No rounds will be replayed due to problems with the robot&rsquo;s program. No AC power will be guaranteed to the participants, even to charge the batteries. Backup must be held by the participants themselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">JUDGING CRITERIA:</span></strong></p>

<p>Time factor. Number of collisions. Number of check points crossed. Number of obstacles overcome. A maximum of three corrections is allowed and for every next correction, points will be deducted. The teams may be asked questions on the design of the circuit and other details on the implementation. Event Managers decisions will be final, and any of the above, mentioned rules can change according to the scenario of the event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>SPECIFICATIONS OF THE TRACK:</strong></span></p>

<p>The track is spread on nearly a 15m x 10m little rough floor. The track width varies from 0.3m-0.7m and is closed on the sides by bricks. The race course has several turns [U-turns, right angled turns, loops], and the path width may be narrow at some places requiring control and stability along with speed. The race course may have wooden obstacles like speed breakers etc.</p>

<p>Note: Above mentioned specifications are tentative, small changes may take place.</p>

But then, and here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting, you apply those algorithms to the hardware, and voila!

							<p class="transition "><p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>About:</strong></span></p>

<p>This year NRC comes back again with an exciting event to present your skills in the field of robotics in the form of LINE FOLLOWER. All you need is to gather your gadgets and come up with marvellous bots to compete against the best rivals. It&rsquo;s time to showcase your passion towards robotics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Problem statement:</strong></span></p>

<p>Line follower is an autonomous robot which follows black line in white background. The objective of this contest is to complete the course in the shortest period of time with less number of deviations from the path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Robot Specifications:</strong></span></p>

<p>The robot must fit on an A4 piece of paper.</p>

<p>There is no weight limitation. Robots must have passed inspection prior to competing.</p>

<p>Robots have to have an easily reachable emergency stop button which interrupts the power supply of the actuators.</p>

<p>On demand of the jury or in imminent danger, a team member has to stop the robot immediately.</p>

<p>Robots have to operate autonomously and should not be remote-controlled.</p>

<p>All systems (like sensors, power supply, data-processing and control-systems) have to completely reside on the robot.</p>

<p>No limitation as such in the motors.</p>

<p>The wheels used must be non-destructive to the surface.</p>

<p>Energy sources like springs, compressed-air, batteries, etc. are permitted.</p>

<p>Combustion engines are not allowed because of noise and exhaust gas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Course Specifications:</strong></span></p>

<p>The line following course shall traverse a white paper rectangle (approx. 3mx1m). The line shall be a black printed one while the base is white traversing the arena from end to end.</p>

<p>The width of the black line is 3cm</p>

<p>There shall be a starting area at the beginning of the course and an exit area at the end. The line course starts inside the starting area and ends inside the exit area.</p>

<p>There shall be crossovers (e.g. places where the line crosses itself)</p>

<p>Switchbacks and hairpins are possible, but the adjacent sections of the line shall be no closer together than 15cm when measured from the center of each line.</p>

<p>The line course may have one or more sharp right-angle and some acute and obtuse angles.</p>

<p>The closest approach of the line course to the edges of the arena shall be no less than 15cm, measured from the center of the line.</p>

<p>The decisions of all officials regarding these rules and the conduct of the event shall be final.</p>

<p>There will be a total of three rounds and we will be following a knockout system for each round</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Rules and regulations:</strong></span></p>

<p>Team may have a maximum of 5 members.</p>

<p>The robot has to be developed and designed by the team itself. The usage of commercially complete robotic-systems which are sold ready for the purpose of the competition is not allowed. At least the software-development should show significant personal effort.</p>

<p>The time of any run is measured from the time the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when the forward most wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line.</p>

<p>Time measurement: Time shall be measured by an electronic gate system or by a judge with a stopwatch, based on the availability of equipment. In either case the recorded time shall be final.</p>

<p>A robot that wanders off of the arena surface will be disqualified.</p>

<p>A robot shall be deemed to have left the arena when any wheel, leg, or track has moved completely off the arena surface.</p>

<p>Losing the Line: any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point.</p>

<p>Robots have to stay on the ground. Thus they may not fly or jump. All kinds of weapons (saws, lasers, electroshocks, hammer) are strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>Claims because of changing lighting conditions in the room or flash lights of photographers won&#39;t be accepted. Participants have to face these &quot;disturbances&quot;.</p>

<p>Equipment which harms or disturbs another robot (e.g. jammer, light flash, interfering ultrasonic or infrared transmitter) are forbidden. Disturbances or assistance caused by intervention of humans during a competition are forbidden as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong></span></p>

<p>A maximum time of 5 minutes is allowed for a robot to complete the course. A robot that cannot complete the course in the allotted time shall be disqualified.</p>

<p>The track is divided into checkpoints at various locations.</p>

<p>On completion of the whole track in given time, the team is given 40 points.</p>

<p>For teams which complete within 5 minutes extra points will be given</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round-1:</strong></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">A team will be awarded 20 points upon crossing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">In this round a maximum of 3 corrections are allowed. For every next correction the team will be&nbsp;deducted with 3 points.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 2:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teams which clear round 1 will participate in this round</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">A team will be awarded 30 points on crossing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">In this round no corrections are allowed. For any correction the team will be deducted with 5 points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 3:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teams which clear the previous rounds will participate in this&nbsp;round</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp; A team will be awarded 50 points on crossing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp;In this round no corrections are allowed. For any correction the team will be deducted with 8 points.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The organizers reserve the right to change any or all of the rules as they deem fit.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>BOT SPECIFICATIONS:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;The machine should fit in a box of dimension 60cm x 60cm x 60cm (l x b x h) during the starting of the match. The external device (remote) used to control the machine is not included in the size constraint. (However there is no limitation on dimension once the match starts). The ground clearance of the bot must be 3mm for bot&#39;s convienience. 10% allowance in dimensions shall be given to the bots with on board power supply</p>

<p>The machine should not exceed 60&nbsp;kg of weight including power supply. Here the power supply refers to the wires in externally powered bot and battery for a wireless bot. 10% allowance in weight shall be given to the bots with off board power supply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;MOBILITY:</strong></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; The bots should use only wheels for moving.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Jumping, Flying, Hopping of bots is not allowed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;ROBOT CONTROL:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; The machine can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. Off board power supplies are allowed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the machine is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the machine should be stacked as a single unit. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires. Loose connections may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.</li>
	<li>If the machine is controlled wirelessly, the machine must at least have a four frequency control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.</li>
	<li>The robots are not allowed to cut the opponents control wire.</li>
	<li>Violation of this rule will lead to disqualification</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;POWER SYSTEM:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>The bot must be powered by electrical means only. Other means of powering the system like use of IC engines, Pneumatics in any form is not allowed.</p>

<p>The electric voltage between any two points in a machine should not exceed 36v DC at any point of time. The same is the case with AC as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;BATTERY:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;On board Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).</p>

<p>&nbsp;All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct&nbsp; &nbsp;disqualification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>&nbsp;USAGE OF WEAPONS:</strong></span></p>

<p>Robots can have any kind of magnetic weapons, cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. as weapons with following exceptions and limitations:</p>

<ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;:&nbsp;</span>STEPHEN HAWKING</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">About:</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mobile controlled robot gives an opportunity for the electronics amateurs to showcase their skills in robotics. All you need is the desire, enthusiasm and passion towards robotics. Gear up your DTMF controlled robots and race off against your counterparts. Stay focused and zoom off to grab the crown of Mobile Controlled Robot. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">Problem Statement:</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Mobile Controlled Robot is a mobile device, which provides wide-range of wireless control ability to your robot unless your cell phone gets out of signal. The objective is to build a bot which can navigate using your instructions through DTMF controlled by your mobile phone and maneuver the bot through the arena.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>TEAMDETAILS:</strong></p>

<p>Each team consists a maximum of 5 members. Only one member of the team is allowed to handle the bot during a match.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">SPECIFICATIONS:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Base of the machine must not be greater than 0.30 m * 0.25 m (Length * Breadth). No limit on weight of the bot&nbsp;control of the bot can be done through any switches in the mobile which the participants are using communication between the rover and the participant will be through DTMF. It cannot be IR beams, GSM, Bluetooth and radio services. Onboard power supply should not exceed 12V DC between any two points in the machine. A robot&rsquo;s program is the responsibility of the team. No rounds will be replayed due to problems with the robot&rsquo;s program. No AC power will be guaranteed to the participants, even to charge the batteries. Backup must be held by the participants themselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px">JUDGING CRITERIA:</span></strong></p>

<p>Time factor. Number of collisions. Number of check points crossed. Number of obstacles overcome. A maximum of three corrections is allowed and for every next correction, points will be deducted. The teams may be asked questions on the design of the circuit and other details on the implementation. Event Managers decisions will be final, and any of the above, mentioned rules can change according to the scenario of the event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>SPECIFICATIONS OF THE TRACK:</strong></span></p>

<p>The track is spread on nearly a 15m x 10m little rough floor. The track width varies from 0.3m-0.7m and is closed on the sides by bricks. The race course has several turns [U-turns, right angled turns, loops], and the path width may be narrow at some places requiring control and stability along with speed. The race course may have wooden obstacles like speed breakers etc.</p>

<p>Note: Above mentioned specifications are tentative, small changes may take place.</p>
